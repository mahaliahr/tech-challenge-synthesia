(Bad)JokeGenerator here: (https://mahaliahr.github.io/tech-challenge-synthesia/)

Key things that I would want to add/improve to optimise the experience is:

* fetch and pull videos from server without having them in an array within the js file
* ensure that the random function does not call the same number twice (so we don't have repeating videos)
* better UI and more sophisticated layout
* Use AI to generate the jokes in some way, so that the jokes 'truly don't exist'
