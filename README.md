(Bad)JokeGenerator here: (https://mahaliahr.github.io/tech-challenge-synthesia/)

Key things that I would want to optimise about the experience is:

* fetch and pull videos from server without having them in an array within the js file
* ensure that the random funtion does not call the same number twice (so we don't have repeating videos)
* Use AI to generate the jokes in some way so that the jokes 'truly don't exist'
